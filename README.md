## Application Demo
[Live app](https://chefthomas.github.io/pluma/ "Pluma ")

## Description
eBird is an online database of bird observations providing scientists, researchers and amateur naturalists with real-time data about bird distribution and abundance on a global scale. 

Pluma provides access to the eBird database in an intuitive way that allows users to view what birds have been recently sighted by eBird users at a location within a specified radius. 

Results are returned as a list of sightings that users selectively map and draw routes to from their own location. Clickable markers on the map provide additional info on location as well as sighting date. 

Pluma provides guidance to users who aim to view specific species in the field. This function is particularly useful for travelling users with limited time at a given location. Speaking from my own perspective as a birder, it's also simply fun to see what birders in exotic locations are viewing.
